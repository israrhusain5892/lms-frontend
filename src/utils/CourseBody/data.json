It allows you to ensure that your content is understood by both segments of your audience: the people who watch, read, or listen to your content, and the computers that display it. In this course, learn how to craft excellent HTML with the pieces that HTML itself has to offer. Instructor Jen Simmons highlights all of the fundamental concepts you need to use HTML thoughtfully. She focuses on semantic markup: tagging content as what it is, and not just for formatting, convention, or convenience."
